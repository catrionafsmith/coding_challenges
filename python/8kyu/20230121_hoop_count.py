#  8kyu Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)


# My ideas:
#  if/else statement
#  one line

def hoop_count(n):
    return "Great, now move on to tricks" if n >= 10 else "Keep at it until you get it"
         

# my solution == Codewars best practices.
