#8kyu Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
# If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

# The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

# name + " plays banjo" 
# name + " does not play banjo"

# My ideas:
# use if/then. use ternary operator?

def are_you_playing_banjo(name):
    return f"{name} plays banjo" if name[0].lower() == "r" else f"{name} does not play banjo" 

# Codewars improved refactor
def areYouPlayingBanjo(name):
    return name + (' plays' if name[0].lower() == 'r' else ' does not play') + " banjo";
