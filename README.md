# coding_challenges
A repo to store my completed coding challenges plus my notes and reflections on them. These challenges are mainly from Codewars, and have been completed with the aim of:
- practicing Python/JS logic and syntax
- practicing git commands
- communicating my thought process and reflecting on other solutions to improve my own knowledge
- broadening my knowledge of common Python/JS functions.

An example is below:
